# CiteSeer Citation Classification

1. 

As an Insight Data Science Fellow, I consulted for NASA's Space Telescope Sciences Institute to help them classify different types of citations of thier community-contributed data products (CCDPs). 

There are two major types of citations, using Smith and Wesson (2016) as an example:

(a) the use of data in a CCDP collection

an example: "Using our star/galaxy separator algorithm on the image stacks created by Smith & Wesson (2016), we find that the number of galaxies relative to field stars increases dramatically with photometric depth."

(b) the mention of scientific results without analyzing the CCDP data. 

An example: "As shown by Smith & Wesson (2016), the ratio of the number of galaxies relative to field stars increases dramatically with photometric depth."
